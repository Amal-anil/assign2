                        In the technical sense a journal has continuous
                        pagination throughout a volume. Thus Business Week,
                        which starts each issue anew with page one, is a
                        magazine, but the Journal of Business Communication,
                        which continues the same sequence of pagination
                        throughout the coterminous year, is a journal. Some
                        professional or trade publications are also
                        peer-reviewed, for example the Journal of Accountancy.
                        Non-peer-reviewed academic or professional publications
                        are generally professional magazines.

                        The earliest example of magazines was<b>
                            Erbauliche Monaths Unterredungen</b
                        >, a literary and philosophy magazine, which was
                        launched in <b>1663 in Germany</b>.[6] The Gentleman's
                        Magazine, first published in 1731 in London was the
                        first general-interest magazine.[7]
                        <b>Edward Cave,</b> who edited The Gentleman's Magazine
                        under the pen name <b>"Sylvanus Urban"</b>, was the
                        first to use the term "magazine", on the analogy of a
                        military storehouse,[8] the quote being: "a monthly
                        collection, to treasure up as in a magazine".[9] Founded
                        by Herbert Ingram in 1842, The Illustrated London News
                        was the first illustrated weekly news magazine.[7]
